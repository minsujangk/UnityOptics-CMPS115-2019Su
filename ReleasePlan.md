## High Level Goals  

Our project aims to implement a Unity Engine plugin providing 3D-based advertisement tools for monetization  

Our goal is making a plugin that  

- Displays appropriate advertisements  
- Tracks playersâ€™ interactions with ads  
- Saves information to database for on-storage analysis and computation

## User stories  

### Sprint 1  

- As a game developer I want data from time spent watching an object in-game
- As a game developer I want to know when an object is within a player's view 
- As a game developer I want to marshal this data into a file

### Sprint 2  

- As a game developer I want to format and store my data into a database
- As a game developer I want a simple API to access data from my player's game

### Sprint 3  

- As a game developer I want to use the data to derive useful information
- As a game developer I want to be able to manage multiple instances of plugin-attached objects

## Product Backlog

- Advertisement recommendation: Seems to be out of scope  
- Showing real advertisements: As this is more about business, we decided to omit this part. We will try to simulate some behaviors of advertisements.
